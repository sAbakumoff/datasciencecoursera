This repository contains the complete solution for the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course that is available at https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006

The project goal is transformation of the input data from mutiple files to the single output data set.
The input data represent measures collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
Here are the input data:

The repository includes the following files:

* 'README.md' : this file
* 'CodeBook.md': explains the way the input data are cleaned and transformed, describes the output data set and its variables
* 'run_analysis.R' : R script that performs the transformation on the input data
* 'summary.txt' : the output data

run_analysis.R assumes that it is located in the root folder of the input data directory
